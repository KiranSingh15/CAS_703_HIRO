### Image Processing with OpenCV
## Overview
This project performs image processing operations using OpenCV, including:
- Converting an image to grayscale
- Applying a Gaussian filter
- Applying a Laplacian filter

## Features
- **Convert to Grayscale:** Converts an RGB image to grayscale.
- **Apply Gaussian Filter:** Smooths the image to reduce noise.
- **Apply Laplacian Filter:** Detects edges after Gaussian smoothing.
- **Execution Time Measurement:** 
- **Manual Thread Configuration:** The number of threads can be set via a command-line argument.
